    "### Forwards and Futures\n",
    "\n",
    "Forwards and Futures are one of the simplest derivatives to begin with. The basic idea is to try and lock in a price now for a future transaction\n",
    "More formally, a forward is simply a legal contract to trade some commodity at a fixed price in a specific time in the future. Typically at the time of delivery, you can either accept physical delivery or do a cash settlement. A cash settlement will lead to a payoff of S(T) - F for the Long and a F - S(T) payoff for the Short. This is partially why many derivatives including these are considered \"zero sum\". "
